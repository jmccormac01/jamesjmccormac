                    When browsing the web researching things to buy or places to visit, I find customer reviews indispensable. 
                    Therefore, I normally try to write some reviews of my own, good or bad. Be it of software I've used, toys my son has asked for
                    , restaurants or tourist attractions. My plan is to include my reviews here also in the hope that people find them useful.
